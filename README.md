# Cephalon Navis

Cephalon Navis  is an Android app inspired by [Warframe Hub](https://hub.warframestat.us/). At the moment not all information is currently showed by the app, if you do have some info that you want to see let me know.

To build Navis you must first install Flutter from the link below and follow all the instructions needed to get it running for your desired device* then simple run:

```
flutter packages get
flutter build apk
flutter install
```
make sure that you follow all the instructions and everything should run smoothly, unless there's a bug in which case report it so I can take care of it

Some screen shots to show progress of what I have so far, animations is a lot smoother in person.

keep in mind that I am an amateur at this, and I am still learning to code.

*Note although the app was built using the flutter engine I have not tested it on IOS due to not owing a IDevice or OSX to test on. Might not even compile properly. And a few of the plugins used in this app are not compatible with IOS
